# monkethemes
monkethemes is an open-source project for sharing and interacting with custom-made MonkeyType themes. Users can simply provide a theme link and our backend generates all the previews. We also have a neat Discord integration for sharing and liking themes directly from the MonkeyType Discord server.

**Highlights:**
- 💾 Share your MonkeyType themes
- 🔍 Instant search with instantsearch.js
- 🎨 Customise your themes
- 💬 Discord integration
- 🔦 Theme filtering based on various criteria
